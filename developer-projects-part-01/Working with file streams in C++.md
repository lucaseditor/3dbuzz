# Working with file streams in C++
This short series goes over the basics of reading and writing to file streams in C++.

### 01 - Introduction
For starters, we take a look at the objectives for this project and discuss prerequisites and upcoming topics.

### 02 - Project Setup
In this video we set up the Xcode project. Please note that there is no cause for concern if you are following along in Visual Studio or similar IDE.

### 03 - President Class
Now that we have created our CSV files, we now need to create the class file to store the data from those CSV files.

### 04 - Test Methods
The President class is now complete, and so we begin working in our main.cpp file, starting with a test method to verify our parsing behavior.

### 05 - Read CSV
We are now ready to create our first CSV reading method, which will take in our presidents list.

### 06 - Read CSV with Comments
Our normal CSV reading file is now done, but we want to be able to read in our other CSV file as well. Here we finalize our code and wrap up the lesson.
